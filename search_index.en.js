It changes the UI ratio to fit each resolution.\nTo take a screenshot on a part of a screen, we need input a resolution but we cannot know the object size on each device. Do we need calculate each device ratio for taking a screenshot on a game result and a user profile?\nNo. We can do it just with using another canvas or changing CanvasScaler by a script.\n\nEnvironment: Unity 2018.4.6f\n\nHow to take a screen shot\nSupport multiple ratio by other canvas\nChange UI Scale Mode for ScreenShot\nReferences\n\nHow to take a screenshot in Unity\nWe can screenshot a game scene with Unity's API.&nbsp; The API is several types in Unity, each of which has slightly different features.*1 often use Texture2D. It's easy, yet flexible.\nusing System.Collections;\nusing UnityEngine;\nusing System.IO;\nusing System;\npublic class ScreenshotGenerater : MonoBehaviour {\n    [SerializeField] Vector2Int imageSize = new Vector2Int (500, 250);\n    //Set to ButtonEvent.\n\tpublic void LoadTexsture() {\n        StartCoroutine(\"TakeScreenshot\");\n    }\n\n    IEnumerator TakeScreenshot() {\n        //Wait until rendered.\n        yield return new WaitForEndOfFrame();\n\n        //Create a new texture with the width and height of the screen\n        Texture2D texture = new Texture2D(imageSize.x, imageSize.y, TextureFormat.RGB24, false);\n\n        //case: we take a pic on the center of screen\n        //If you take a ScreenShot of the resolution size, you can use the following code.\n        //texture.ReadPixels(new Rect(0, 0, Screen.width, Screen.height), 0, 0, false);\n        float imagePosX = (Screen.width - imageSize.x) / 2;\n        float imagePosY = (Screen.height - imageSize.y) / 2;\n\n        texture.ReadPixels(new Rect(imagePosX, imagePosY, imageSize.x, imageSize.y), 0, 0);\n        texture.Apply();\n        //Can select file extention\n        byte[] jpgFile = texture.EncodeToJPG();\n        //Release explicitly.     \n        DestroyImmediate(texture);\n        \n        //Use the date in the file name,\n        //as it will be overwritten if the same file is present.\n        string savePath = \"/screenshot/\" + DateTime.Now.ToString(\"MMdd_hhmmss\") + \".jpg\";\n\n        File.WriteAllBytes(Application.dataPath + savePath, jpgFile);\n    }\n}\n\nScreen.width and Screen.height are the actual width of the player window.*2 This means that if we support multiple resolutions, the value of screen size is not always fixed number.\n \nSo, when we take a ScreenShot on other resolution, the images change.&nbsp;\n 　　\nIf we take a screenshot of the entire screen, there is no problem. But we cannot use it to share at a specific size in a social media.\nTake a screenshot regardless of Resolution by using other Canvas\nThis cause is Scale With Screen Size on Canvas Scaler to support multiple resolutions. We just use the other Canvas instead of it to take a screenshot regardless of resolution!\nThe Canvas that set Constant Pixel Size has the fixed size value. \n \nWe duplicate the contents making a image to the other Canvas, and all we need is activate it before taking a screenshot.\n \nWe need also fix the code to switch the Canvas active.\nusing System.Collections;\nusing UnityEngine;\nusing System.IO;\nusing System;\npublic class ScreenshotGenerater : MonoBehaviour {\n    [SerializeField] Vector2Int imageSize = new Vector2Int (500, 250);\n    [SerializeField] GameObject screenshotCanvas;\n\n    //Set to ButtonEvent.\n\tpublic void LoadTexsture() {\n        //Change Canvas active.\n        screenshotCanvas.SetActive(true);\n        StartCoroutine(\"TakeScreenshot\");\n    }\n\n    IEnumerator TakeScreenshot() {\n        //Wait until rendered.\n        yield return new WaitForEndOfFrame();\n\n        //Create a new texture with the width and height of the screen.\n        Texture2D texture = new Texture2D(imageSize.x, imageSize.y, TextureFormat.RGB24, false);\n\n        //case: we take a pic on the center of screen\n        //If you take a ScreenShot of the resolution size, you can use the following code.\n        //texture.ReadPixels(new Rect(0, 0, Screen.width, Screen.height), 0, 0, false);\n        float imagePosX = (Screen.width - imageSize.x) / 2;\n        float imagePosY = (Screen.height - imageSize.y) / 2;\n\n        texture.ReadPixels(new Rect(imagePosX, imagePosY, imageSize.x, imageSize.y), 0, 0);\n        texture.Apply();\n        //Can select file extention.\n        byte[] jpgFile = texture.EncodeToJPG();\n        //Release explicitly.     \n        DestroyImmediate(texture);\n        //Change Canvas active.\n        screenshotCanvas.SetActive(false);\n        \n        //Use the date in the file name,\n        //as it will be overwritten if the same file is present.\n        string savePath = \"/\" + DateTime.Now.ToString(\"MMdd_hhmmss\") + \".jpg\";\n\n        File.WriteAllBytes(Application.dataPath + savePath, jpgFile);\n    }\n}\n\nThe results are as follows. The content is now the same and the ideal screenshot is created!\n 　　\nSwitch the Canvas config before screenshot\nWe can always get the same size screenshot by using another Canvas, but this method is not practical. It’s good as long as the data is small, but it’s not for taking a complex data. This is because all the data must be reflected in another Canvas too.\nSo, Let’s switch the configuration of the Canvas where the user profile or game results are placed from the script, and take a screenshot. Note that the change is seen in game scene: changing the CanvasScaler needs one frame, and drawing it one more frame. The result is we can see a UI for screenshot ratios.\nusing System.Collections;\nusing UnityEngine.UI; //For CanvasScale\nusing UnityEngine;\nusing System.IO;\nusing System;\npublic class ScreenshotGenerater2 : MonoBehaviour {\n    [SerializeField] Vector2Int imageSize = new Vector2Int (500, 250);\n    //Get reference on UnityEditor.\n    [SerializeField] CanvasScaler screenshotCanvas;\n\n    //Set to ButtonEvent.\n\tpublic void LoadTexsture() {\n        //Switch ScaleMode\n        screenshotCanvas.uiScaleMode = CanvasScaler.ScaleMode.ConstantPixelSize;\n        StartCoroutine(\"TakeScreenshot\");\n    }\n\n    IEnumerator TakeScreenshot() {\n        //Wait until rendered.\n        yield return null; //Switch CanvasScaler\n        yield return new WaitForEndOfFrame(); //Draw it\n\n        //Create a new texture with the width and height of the screen.\n        Texture2D texture = new Texture2D(imageSize.x, imageSize.y, TextureFormat.RGB24, false);\n\n        //case: we take a pic on the center of screen\n        //If you take a ScreenShot of the resolution size, you can use the following code.\n        //texture.ReadPixels(new Rect(0, 0, Screen.width, Screen.height), 0, 0, false);\n        float imagePosX = (Screen.width - imageSize.x) / 2;\n        float imagePosY = (Screen.height - imageSize.y) / 2;\n\n        texture.ReadPixels(new Rect(imagePosX, imagePosY, imageSize.x, imageSize.y), 0, 0);\n        texture.Apply();\n        //Can select file extention.\n        byte[] jpgFile = texture.EncodeToJPG();\n        //Release explicitly.     \n        DestroyImmediate(texture);\n        //Switch ScaleMode\n        screenshotCanvas.uiScaleMode = CanvasScaler.ScaleMode.ScaleWithScreenSize;\n        screenshotCanvas.matchWidthOrHeight = 0f;\n\n        //Use the date in the file name,\n        //as it will be overwritten if the same file is present.\n        string savePath = \"/\" + DateTime.Now.ToString(\"MMdd_hhmmss\") + \".jpg\";\n\n        File.WriteAllBytes(Application.dataPath + savePath, jpgFile);\n    }\n}\n\nSummary\nScreenshot is necessary to share play data on social media. It's easy to take a full screen shot, but it takes a bit of work to process the image for ideal. You should try this method!\ninter0\nReferences\n*APIs for screenshot\n‣Unity - Scripting API: ScreenCapture.CaptureScreenshot\n‣Unity - Manual: Render Texture\n‣Unity - Scripting API: Texture2D.ReadPixels\nUnity - Scripting API: Screen.width\nRenderTexture coordinate system origin is bottom-left on iPad, but top-left on iPhone 5S - Unity Forum\nUnity - Scripting API: UI.CanvasScaler.uiScaleMode\n","id":"https://blog.skeyll.net/take-screenshots-unity/","title":"Take same size Screenshots regardless of resolutions - Unity"}},"docInfo":{"https://blog.skeyll.net/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://blog.skeyll.net/animator-anystate/":{"body":305,"title":4},"https://blog.skeyll.net/how-2d-animation/":{"body":58,"title":1},"https://blog.skeyll.net/how-touchscript/":{"body":159,"title":1},"https://blog.skeyll.net/multiple-inputs-button/":{"body":395,"title":7},"https://blog.skeyll.net/scriptableobject-perfect-guide/":{"body":588,"title":3},"https://blog.skeyll.net/take-screenshots-unity/":{"body":651,"title":7}},"length":7},"lang":"English"};
